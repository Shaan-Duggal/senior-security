      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Senior Security helps older adults, families, and caregivers prevent scams through practical education and supportive resources.
      </p>

      <h2>Our story</h2>
      <p>
        We saw too many people blamed or isolated after fraud attempts. We built Senior Security to make prevention and recovery easier, kinder, and more actionable.
      </p>

      <h2>Our approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use plain language and short steps.</li>
        <li>Lead with calm choices, not fear.</li>
        <li>Offer tools people can use the same day.</li>
        <li>Design resources that families can share.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Values</h2>
      <p>
        Respect, clarity, accessibility, and community care guide everything we publish.
      </p>

      <h2>Ambassador program</h2>
      <p>
        TODO: Add final Ambassador program description when program details are approved.
