## How it works
A scammer posts an attractive product listing online. After payment, shipment keeps getting delayed, tracking is fake, or the seller disappears.

## Red flags
- Prices far below normal market value.
- Seller requests payment outside the platform.
- New account with little history and no verified reviews.
- Pressure to pay quickly to "reserve" the item.

## What to do
- Use trusted marketplaces and protected payment methods.
- Review seller history and return policies.
- Keep all confirmation emails and screenshots.

## What never to do
- Never pay through gift cards, wire transfer, or direct crypto for routine purchases.
- Never move a transaction off-platform to save a small fee.
- Never ignore your instincts when details do not line up.

## If money was sent: steps
1. Contact your payment provider and request dispute options.
2. Report the seller to the marketplace.
3. Save order details, tracking links, and chat logs.
4. File reports with FTC and IC3 if fraud is suspected.
