## How it works
A scammer pretends to be from a trusted organization such as Social Security, Medicare, your bank, or a utility company. They may say your account is locked, your identity was used, or you owe money right away.

## Red flags
- Pressure to act immediately.
- Threats about arrest, service shutoff, or frozen accounts.
- Requests for gift cards, wire transfers, crypto, or unusual payment methods.
- Caller ID, email names, or logos that look official but feel slightly off.

## What to do
- Pause and end the call if pressure starts.
- Contact the organization yourself using a number from its official website or your statement.
- Ask a trusted person to review the message before you respond.

## What never to do
- Never share one-time codes, banking passwords, or Social Security details because someone asked urgently.
- Never trust a callback number in the suspicious message.
- Never pay with gift cards, wire transfer, or crypto to fix an urgent “problem.”

## If money was sent: steps
1. Contact your bank or payment provider immediately and ask if a reversal or hold is possible.
2. Save receipts, screenshots, and any phone numbers used.
3. Change passwords for email and financial accounts.
4. File reports with FTC and IC3.
