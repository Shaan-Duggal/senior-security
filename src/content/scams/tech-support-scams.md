## How it works
You receive a pop-up, call, text, or email saying your computer has a virus. The scammer poses as a support technician and asks you to install remote software so they can "fix" it.

## Red flags
- Unsolicited pop-ups with loud warnings and countdown timers.
- Requests to install remote access tools.
- Demands for immediate payment to unlock your device.
- Pressure to keep the call secret.

## What to do
- Close the pop-up without clicking links.
- Disconnect from the internet if you think remote access was granted.
- Use a trusted local technician or your device maker's official support page.
- Run a malware scan with software you already trust.

## What never to do
- Never call the number shown in a suspicious pop-up.
- Never grant remote control to unknown people.
- Never pay support fees using gift cards or crypto.

## If money was sent: steps
1. Contact your bank or card provider and request fraud support.
2. Uninstall unknown remote tools and scan the device.
3. Change passwords from a separate trusted device.
4. Monitor accounts for unusual transactions.
