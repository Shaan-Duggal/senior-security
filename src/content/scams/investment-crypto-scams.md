## How it works
Scammers pitch fake investment platforms, crypto opportunities, or account "recovery" services. Early screenshots may show fake gains to build trust before bigger transfers are requested.

## Red flags
- Guaranteed returns or no-risk claims.
- Urgent instructions to move funds quickly.
- Pressure to keep the opportunity private.
- Requests to download unfamiliar apps or move money to personal wallets.

## What to do
- Verify licenses and registrations before investing.
- Discuss any opportunity with a trusted financial professional.
- Treat screenshots as unverified until money is successfully withdrawn.

## What never to do
- Never invest because someone says "act now" or "limited spot."
- Never borrow money to chase promised returns.
- Never send crypto to recover earlier losses.

## If money was sent: steps
1. Contact your financial institution immediately.
2. Save wallet addresses, transaction IDs, and communication logs.
3. Report to FTC and IC3 quickly.
4. Stop contact with anyone offering paid "recovery" as a guaranteed fix.
