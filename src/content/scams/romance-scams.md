## How it works
A scammer creates a close emotional bond through social media, text, or dating platforms. After trust forms, they present a crisis and ask for financial help.

## Red flags
- Quick declarations of deep affection.
- Refusal to meet in person or join a live video call.
- Repeated emergencies involving travel, medical care, or legal trouble.
- Requests for secrecy from family or friends.

## What to do
- Slow down and verify identity through real-world checks.
- Talk with a trusted friend before sending money.
- Use reverse image search for profile photos.

## What never to do
- Never send money, gift cards, or crypto to someone you have not verified.
- Never share account access or private IDs.
- Never isolate yourself from support while making money decisions.

## If money was sent: steps
1. Contact payment providers immediately.
2. Save profiles, usernames, and chat history.
3. Block the scammer on all platforms.
4. File reports with FTC and IC3.
