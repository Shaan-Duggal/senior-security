## How it works
A caller or texter pretends to be a grandchild, relative, or caregiver and says they need urgent help. Sometimes the scammer also impersonates a lawyer, police officer, or hospital staff member.

## Red flags
- Strong pressure to act immediately.
- Requests for secrecy from other family members.
- Payment instructions that bypass normal family communication.
- Vague details that avoid specific facts.

## What to do
- Hang up and call your relative directly using a known number.
- Ask a question only your real family member would answer.
- Confirm the story with another trusted person.

## What never to do
- Never send money based on one call or text.
- Never share personal records without verification.
- Never let urgency replace a quick family check.

## If money was sent: steps
1. Contact the payment company immediately.
2. Save all call logs, texts, and transaction details.
3. Notify family members so they can avoid follow-up attempts.
4. Report to FTC and IC3.
