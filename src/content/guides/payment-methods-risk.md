### Lower risk for many purchases

- Credit card with fraud protections
- Reputable payment platform with buyer protection

### Medium risk

- Debit card (may have protections, but speed matters)
- Bank transfer to a known verified payee

### Higher risk

- Gift cards
- Wire transfers
- Cryptocurrency transfers
- Cash sent by mail

Rule of thumb: if payment is hard to reverse, treat requests with extra caution.
