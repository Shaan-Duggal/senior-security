### Suggested script

"Thank you for calling. I do not make financial or account decisions on unexpected calls. I will hang up and call the official number listed on my statement or the organization's website."

If the caller pushes back:

"I understand. I still need to verify this independently. Goodbye."

### Follow-up steps

- Hang up.
- Look up the official number yourself.
- Call back only through trusted channels.
- Note date, time, and what was requested.
