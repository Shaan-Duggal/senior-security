Take a slow breath before responding.

- Pause before clicking, sharing, or sending money.
- Check whether the request creates fear, urgency, or secrecy.
- Verify using a trusted number or official website you find yourself.
- Ask one trusted person for a second opinion.
- Keep proof (texts, receipts, screenshots) in case reporting is needed.

If a request feels rushed, your pause is protection.
